I chose Babson because it is an all business college.
All the classes here relate to business in some way or form so no time is wasted. 
I love Babson's campus since it is very different from the city I grew up in.
The small class sizes allow me to be active and ask questions in classes rather than just listening to lectures.
I hope to go into marketing analytics after I graduate next May.

My favorite sport is bowling because I do not do well with fast balls flying at me. 
Bowling is more focused on precision and patience rather than speed.
Also with bowling I do not need to run. I just have to sit and roll a ball.
People often tell me bowling is not a sport. They are wrong.
